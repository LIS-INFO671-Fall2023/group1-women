She is holding knitting needles and a knitted garment lays on her lap.,"From the mid 19th to early 20th century, Nevada experienced two major precious metal booms (that involved gold, silver, and copper) that led to a major economic, population, and industry growth in the region. The first major boom lasted from 1860 to 1878, during which Nevada officially became a state in 1864. In merely a year’s time, from 1960 to 1961, Nevada’s population had tripled. The second major boom occurred during 1900 and 1923, which was marked by the establishment of large mining corporations such as Tonopah Mining Company and Goldfield Consolidated Mining Company, as well as the prevalence of silicosis, which is a form of lung disease that caused by inhaling silica or quartzite dust. The woman pictured in this photograph is likely a settler who came to Nevada during one of the precious mining booms.",https://dp.la/item/5db3bd92e081ed73e1f2b8916e5a54d8,"Nevada Mining Photograph Collection; University of Nevada, Las Vegas Digital Collections",https://special.library.unlv.edu/ark:/62930/d1fj29h13#,Home economics; Knitting; Women,UNLV Special Collections and Archives,UNLV Special Collections and Archives,"This material is made available to facilitate private study, scholarship, or research.

Initially, men and young boys were telephone switchboard operators, but the telephone industry later hired women as their main workforce, with Emma Nutt being the first woman operator in 1878. The first automated telephone system was developed in 1892, but, during the beginning of the 20th century, may telephone users relied on services that depended on the work of women switchboard operators. A typical switchboard operator did much more that simply connect phone calls. In addition to this basic service, an operator would get to know the lives of her typical telephone customers to know their particular needs, took messages for her customer’s when the recipient of the call was unavailable, and provided general information such as the time, sports scores, and weather.",https://dp.la/item/318f0df66f9697faa4f5ef495e9c5018,Shipler Commercial Photographers,https://collections.lib.utah.edu/details?id=523600,Telephone operators; Telephone switchboards; Women; Women employees,J.

After the earthquake in San Francisco in 1906, thousands of Japanese immigrants moved from Norther California down to Los Angeles. Japanese Americans in California were the victims of racism, xenophobia, and segregation. However, around 1910, Boyle Heights, which was one of the largest Japanese immigrant communities in Los Angeles, was a location in which Japanese Americans did not face as much discrimination (at least in regard to housing) as they did in other parts of California.

Over the years, the organization changed names several times. From 1909 to 1933 it was called Atlanta Anti-Tuberculosis and Visiting Nurse Association. From 1933 to 1951 it was called Atlanta Anti-Tuberculosis Association. From 1951 to 1973 it was called Atlanta Tuberculosis Association. Finally, in 1973 the name changed to Atlanta Lung Association. The A.L.A. was among the first organizations in Atlanta to offer treatment of tuberculosis to those unable to obtain sanatorium care. Another such organization was the Home Treatment Dispensary, which was administered by private charities. In 1909 the two organizations merged and formed the Atlanta Anti Tuberculosis and Visiting Nurse Association and established their headquarters on the top floor of the Gould building on Decatur Street. Private donations, fund-raising and city and county funds sustained the Association which served both white and black patients. It emphasized health education, early detection, and provided clinic and home care for the indigent and was staffed with paid professionals and volunteers. Atlanta physicians donated medical support in the clinics. During its time in operation, the national death rate from tuberculosis declined dramatically. Success in treating the disease dictated a change in direction to that of general respiratory illnesses; therefore in 1973 the Association changed its name to the Atlanta Lung Association.",https://dp.la/item/67ed316a9f194e12ad339a4663d93d44,Atlanta Lung Association Photograph Collection 1913-1972 (bulk 1945-1955),http://album.atlantahistorycenter.com/cdm/ref/collection/ALung/id/27,"Atlanta Lung Association; Tuberculosis--Georgia--Atlanta; Public health--Georgia--Atlanta; Communicable diseases--Georgia--Atlanta; Nonprofit organizations--Georgia--Atlanta; Tuberculosis--Diagnosis--Georgia--Atlanta; Medical screening--Georgia--Atlanta; Medical care--Georgia--Atlanta; Women--Georgia--Atlanta; Women's clothing--Georgia--Atlanta; Microscopes--Georgia--Atlanta; Radiography, Medical--Georgia--Atlanta; Radiography, Medical--Equipment and supplies; ",Digital Resources of the Kenan Research Center,Atlanta Lung Association photograph,"This material is protected by copyright law.
